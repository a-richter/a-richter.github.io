## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" alt="profile picture" src="image/profile.jpg">

Hi! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the 
[Swedish Institute for Social Research](http://www.sofi.su.se){:target="_blank"}, 
or SOFI in short, at [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se){:target="_blank"}.

Please find my [Curriculum Vitae](cv/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} here or visit me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/richterandre){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interest

Academically, my interests cover applied empirical labor economics and public health, but I am pretty much interested in anything that uses data either in fun, insightful or helpful ways. 

My own research revolves - broadly speaking - around intergenerational mobility and the inheritance of disadvantage. I am particularly interested in the underlying causal mechanisms driving intergenerational associations, and at the moment I focus much on the role of prenatal health. Please find a selection of my projects [here](projects.html).
