Hi! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Swedish Institute for Social Research, Stockholm University](www.sofi.su.se). My research revolves - broadly speaking - around intergenerational mobility and the inheritance of disadvantage. I am particularly interested in the underlying causal mechanisms driving intergenerational associations, with a focus on early childhood conditions and health. 

Some of my current research is listed on [this page](/research/).
If you're interested in obtaining a draft of any of the working
papers, please feel free to email me.

If you want a pdf of my CV, you can get that [here](/cv/cv.pdf)
