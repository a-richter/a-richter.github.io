## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" alt="profile picture" src="image/profile.jpg">

Hi! 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the 
[Swedish Institute for Social Research](http://www.sofi.su.se){:target="_blank"}, 
or SOFI in short, at [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se){:target="_blank"}.

Please find my [Curriculum Vitae](cv/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} here or visit me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/richterandre){:target="_blank"}

## Research Interest

My research revolves - broadly speaking - around intergenerational mobility and the inheritance of disadvantage. I am particularly interested in the underlying causal mechanisms driving intergenerational associations, with a focus on early childhood conditions and health.
